Hey you found Grapheme! It's an interactive, intelligent robot for teaching numbers and letters. 

## Our mission

Each child has it's own perfect age, speed and willigness to learn numbers and letters. Learning should be fun and a game. Consequently a teacher should be able to adapt to the individual needs of a student and provide tasks and content that allows to grow and enjoy learning. With our project we offer the source code and instructions on how to build your own AI robot that is able to interact with your kids and to adapt to their learning trajectories.
